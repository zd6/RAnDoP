# RAnDoP
Repulsion-Based Applied n-dispersion with Distance-Constraints of non-/convex Polygon
### Authors: Zhengguan Dai(Gary), Kathleen Xu, Melkior Ornik
## Motivation
Motivated by the question of optimal facility placement, a classical variant of the p-dispersion problem seeks to place a fixed number of equally sized non-overlapping circles of maximal possible radius into a subset of the two-dimensional Euclidean space.
